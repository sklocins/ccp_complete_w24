                <p>Wren is a tan and brown dog of about 60 lbs.</p>

                <p>Wren is a 10 year old rescue pitbull. We rescued her when she was about one and half years old. She is very sassy, sweet, and silly. She loves to cuddle, play ball, play with her brother, play games she/we make up, and especially she loves to eat.</p>

                <p>Sometimes she plays a game with herself where she chews a head-sized whole in a dog bed, put a toy inside, throws the bed around a few times, and then sticks her head in the bed and tries to find the toy. It looks ridiculious because she walks around with a dog bed on her head while she's finding the toy.</p>

                <p>Yoyo is a black tan and white dog of about 70 lbs.</p>

                <p>Yoyo is a 6ish year old rescue mixed breed. We adopted him two and a half years ago, but we weren't sure of his age when we adopted him. He is very sweet, cuddly, playful, and wiggly-waggy. He loves to be the safety police and bark at people walking by with dogs, come "save" us from things like the vaccuum cleaner, cuddle, go on walks, and do tricks.</p>

                <p>We call Yoyo "Safety Dog" because he is very safety concious and believes that is his job. If he feels anyone might be alarmed, even though they usually are not, he will trip over himself rushing over, and attempt to ascertain the problem and help. He also likes to tell the food delivery people that this is our house by barking like a crazy dog.</p>

                <p>Milly is a large yellow Labrador of about 100+ lbs.</p>

                <p>Milly was my beautiful yellow Labrador growing up. We got her as a little pup when I was 10, and had her 13 years. We all loved her so much. She loved to play fetch, play with other dogs, and would even play soccer and tennis with us! She also loved to cuddle and be silly.</p>

                <p>Although very large (120lbs. at one point!) Milly was a gentle giant, and was in fact a bit of a scaredly cat! She would roll over and be submissive to even very small dogs, in order to be friends. She was afraid of sprinklers, and was utterly convinced the sprinklers were trying to follow her home. She loved to cuddle at night, and if I was out too late, she would bark at my bedroom to tell my mom to get me to come home. She was the best friend a kid could ask for. (I just have one photo of her on this computer unfortunately, but I can't not include her, so I've found similar looking dogs for the rest of the gallery.)</p>

                <p>Jagger was a medium-large Rottwieler mix, that was tri-color, but mostly black.</p>

                <p>Jagger was my partner's family dog. He was incredibly smart, and very kind and loyal. He was so intelligent it was shocking. He loved animals, and was very kind to small dogs and cats. He loved to be wherever his people were. We loved him very much, and he would accompany us on many dates. Everyone in the family loved him so much people would argue over who got to bring him with them to do something!</p>

                <p>He was very silly even though he was so smart. There were two pre-teen girls in his family, and he learned he got a lot of love and could sneak food items when hanging out with them and their friends, since everyone loved him! When he was over at my house when I was hanging out with my partner, if my younger sister had friends over, nothing could keep him from joining in the fun- and stealing a cookie or trying to eat out of the chip bag!</p>

                <p>Often she would hop around like a little bunny! When the snow got too deep, she would also stick her head up like a ground hog when she was outside! She was so happy when my sister had children, and she loved the kids more than anything.</p>
